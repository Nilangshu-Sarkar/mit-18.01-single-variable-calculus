# **MIT 18.01SC: Selected Problem Set Solutions**

### *Conceptual Calculus for Physics | Independent Study by Nilangshu Sarkar*

This repository contains a curated set of solutions from **MIT 18.01SC Single Variable Calculus**, completed as part of my self-directed preparation for theoretical physics.

I did **not** attempt to solve every problem in the course.
Instead, I **selectively solved** the problems that strengthened:

* conceptual understanding beyond high-school calculus
* intuition for physical applications (motion, geometry, arc length, volumes)
* problem-solving depth required for 8.01/8.02/8.03 and advanced physics study
* LaTeX writing and mathematical communication skills

The goal here is *not* to showcase exhaustive coverage, but to document a **focused learning path** that bridges high-school calculus to the level needed in physics research.

## **📘 Contents**

This repository includes selected solutions from the following units:

### **Unit 1**

Differentiation, limits, and basic calculus foundations.
(Only problems relevant for refreshing fundamentals were attempted.)

### **Unit 2**

Applications of differentiation:
Newton’s method, optimization, related rates, and Mean Value Theorem.
I solved only the problems that introduce deeper analytical thinking.

### **Unit 3**

Core integration concepts: definite integrals, FTC, numerical integration.
Only the problems that add conceptual clarity or technique (Simpson's rule, trapezoid rule, Riemann interpretation, etc.) were included.

### **Unit 4**

Physical applications of integrals:
Volumes, arc length, cycloid geometry.
This unit is especially important for physics, and I solved the problems that meaningfully extend intuition (e.g., the cycloid and volume slicing).

### **Unit 5** *(Skipped)*

## **🎯 Purpose of This Work**

This project is part of my long-term path toward becoming a **theoretical physicist**.

Studying MIT 18.01SC selectively allowed me to:

* build a stronger analytical foundation
* connect calculus to physical intuition
* practice expressing mathematics cleanly in LaTeX
* prepare for multivariable calculus (18.02) and differential equations (18.03)
* document my independent learning systematically

The intention is depth, not quantity.
